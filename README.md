## About the genesis of this document
This started in August 2022, when Tchibo asked me (Hannes) to help them with reviewing their junior, professional, and senior software development career levels. I then felt a little reluctance to do that again, but then I did not find my notes from similar work in previous companies, and so I started by writing the “Why” chapter.
Then I caught fire on the subject, and soon I invited more people to join and give their views on the subject. Right now (September 2022) we have a regular meeting with Eberhard Wolff and Robert Albrecht on Fridays and many people left valuable comments. 
Together with Robert and Eberhard, we came to the conclusion, to put this under an open-source license and make it available to the public and get additional feedback. I like the idea of pull requests and other additions from people, and would like to evolve this to something better.
Thankfully, Christian from Tchibo agreed to this. The Idea is that companies could fork and adapt this to their needs.

September 2022, Hannes
